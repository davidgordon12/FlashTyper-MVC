# FlashTyper-MVC
ASP.NET version of my typeracer clone, FlashTyper, featuring leaderboards and profiles.

This is my first 'substantial' ASP.NET project, that wasn't just a means of learning some concept. I am certain that I did not take the best approach on many parts of this project, but that wasn't my focus, I was just trying to get a full fledged web-app up and running

## What I learned
- Using plain SQL statements for data access as opposed to EFCore
- Account Creation
- HTTP Sessions
- Bootstrap
- Logging
- ViewBag
